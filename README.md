# KeyLog
KeyLog is my version of a key logger that I designed entirely using python as an assignment project for my Cyber Security Internship-Training.
# Aim
The purpose of this version of key logger is for parental control and well intended monitoring. Hence there is a GUI involved unlike the invisible keyloggers that are used for malicious purposes.
# Libraries
'Tkinter' library has been used to design the User Interface.  
'keyboard' from 'pynput' to listen to the keystrokes/inputs.  
'json' to store the logs into a json file.  
'subprocess' to open files the contain the keystrokes.
